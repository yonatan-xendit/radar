// serving.knative.dev/Service "api" in "prod" collided with the core
// "" /Service "api" in "prod", and IndexByResource would conflate
// their findings (whichever Finding came last would shadow the other
// in the dedup checkKey, and any lookup by ResourceKey returned the
// pooled set). The fix routes Group through the key.
