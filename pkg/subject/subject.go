// Package subject is the shared resource-identity + grouping vocabulary for the
// platform. internal/issues is its production consumer today: it keys on
// ScopeForKind + StableID at depth-0 (see internal/issues/identity.go). The
// Tier-1 owner-walk and Tier-2 AppOverlay engine are the canonical model that
// pkg/topology's currently-independent logic (top_metrics.go:topOwnerForPod,
// pod_grouping.go:determineGroupKey, managedby.go) is meant to migrate ONTO —
// planned, not yet wired. Until that lands this package is the agreed
// vocabulary, NOT a second live "truth": topology still resolves its own
// grouping, so don't treat subject.Resolve as the running topology path yet.
//
//	Tier-1 Subject (owner-collapsed root controller, deterministic, label-free)
//	Tier-2 AppOverlay (declared-key 8-tier precedence, provenance/confidence/conflicts)
//
// PLACEMENT NOTE: pkg/subject imports only the canonical-key helper from
// pkg/resourceid (ResourceKey). It does NOT import internal/* or pkg/topology (the
// plan's layering rule). The Tier-1 owner walk is parameterized over an
// OwnerResolver interface — which a topology adapter must satisfy with a
// CONTROLLER-ownership resolver, NOT a raw walkTopmostOwner (see OwnerResolver's
// contract: EdgeManages also carries GitOps/Helm management edges, which are
// Tier-2, not identity). A heuristic single-pod walk is built in. Tier-2 takes
// only a metav1.Object's labels/annotations, so it has zero topology dependency.
