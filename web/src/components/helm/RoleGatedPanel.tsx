/**
 * RoleGatedPanel wraps tab-content surfaces that require a Cloud role
 * (member+) to view. Renders the children when the gate passes; renders
 * an explanatory empty state when the caller's role is insufficient.
 *
 * Why a per-tab gate rather than hiding tabs from the list: viewers
 * should learn what the platform offers and what their tier can't do,
 * not have features silently vanish. This mirrors how the action
 * buttons (Uninstall, Upgrade, etc.) are rendered visible-but-disabled
 * with a role-aware tooltip.
 *
 * Bypasses for non-Cloud users (OSS, OIDC, etc.) — `canAtLeast` returns
 * true when no Cloud role is present. The backend gate has the same
 * shape, so the SPA stays in lockstep.
