 * Compute panel saturation as a ratio of peak observed value to its
 * operational ceiling. Picks the limit reference when both are present
 * (limit is the OOM/throttle boundary; request is the scheduler reservation —
 * the operationally meaningful number).
 *
 * Returns `undefined` for:
 * - empty series (nothing to derive a peak from)
 * - all-zero data (peak <= 0)
 * - no usable reference (missing, or ref.value <= 0)
 *
 * Callers should treat `undefined` as "don't render a saturation chip".
