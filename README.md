## Views

### Topology

Interactive graph showing how your Kubernetes resources are connected in real-time.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/topology-view.png" alt="Topology View" width="800">
  <br><em>Topology View — Visualize resource relationships</em>
</p>

- Two modes: **Resources** (full hierarchy) and **Traffic** (network flow path)
- Group by namespace, app label, or view ungrouped
- Filter by resource kind — click any node for full details
- Auto-layout powered by ELK.js, live updates via SSE

### Resources

Table-based resource browser with smart columns per resource kind.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/resources-view.png" alt="Resources View" width="800">
  <br><em>Resources View — Browse and filter all cluster resources</em>
</p>

- Browse all resource types including CRDs
- Search by name, filter by status or problems (CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, etc.)
- Click any resource for YAML manifest, related resources, logs, and events

### Image Filesystem Viewer

Inspect container image filesystems directly from the Pod view — no need to pull images locally or exec into containers.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/image-filesystem-viewer.png" alt="Image Filesystem Viewer" width="800">
  <br><em>Image Filesystem Viewer — Browse container image contents</em>
</p>

- Click any container image in a Pod to browse its complete filesystem
- Tree view with file sizes, permissions, and symlink targets
- Search files by name across the entire image
- Download individual files for inspection
- Works with public images (Docker Hub, Quay, GHCR) and private registries (GCR, ECR, ACR) using your cluster's ImagePullSecrets
- Disk-based layer caching for fast repeated access

### Timeline

Unified timeline of Kubernetes events and resource changes.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/timeline-view.png" alt="Timeline View" width="800">
  <br><em>Timeline View — Track cluster activity in real-time</em>
</p>

- Filter by event type (all or warnings only)
- Resource change diffs showing what changed (replicas, images, etc.)
- Real-time updates as new events occur

### Helm

Manage Helm releases deployed in your cluster.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/helm-view.png" alt="Helm View" width="800">
  <br><em>Helm View — Manage your Helm deployments</em>
</p>

- View all releases across namespaces with status, chart version, and app version
- Inspect values, compare revisions, view release history
- Upgrade, rollback, or uninstall releases directly from the UI

### Compare Resources

Diff any two Kubernetes resources of the same kind side-by-side — like comparing a staging Deployment to its production sibling, or two pods that should be identical but aren't.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/compare-view.png" alt="Compare View" width="800">
  <br><em>Compare View — Side-by-side YAML diff with field-level highlighting</em>
</p>

- **Two entry points**: a `Compare` button in the resource detail drawer, or compare mode in the resource table (toggle, pick two rows, hit Compare)
- **Side-by-side or unified** view, with one-click swap of A ↔ B
- **Diff-only mode** collapses unchanged regions so you only see what differs
- **Spec-only mode** drops `status` fields to focus on intent rather than observed state
- Server-assigned noise (`managedFields`, `resourceVersion`, `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration`) is stripped automatically so the diff stays signal — flip **Raw metadata** on if you actually want to see it
- Same-namespace candidates are surfaced first in the picker — usually the resource you want to compare against
- Shareable URLs: `/compare?kind=&apiGroup=&a=ns/name&b=ns/name`

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/compare-mode-tray.png" alt="Compare Mode Tray" width="800">
  <br><em>Compare mode in the resource table — pick two rows, hit Compare</em>
</p>

### TLS Certificate Management

View TLS certificate details and expiry dates across all namespaces — catch expiring certificates before they cause outages.

- Parses TLS secrets to show certificate subject, issuer, and validity period
- Dashboard-level certificate expiry overview
- Available from the resource detail view for any TLS-type Secret

### GitOps

Monitor, diagnose, and manage FluxCD and ArgoCD resources from a dedicated GitOps workspace.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/gitops-view.png" alt="GitOps fleet view" width="800">
  <br><em>GitOps fleet view — Argo + Flux applications side-by-side with sync, health, source, destination, and lifecycle state</em>
</p>

- Fleet view + per-app detail page (Topology / Changes / Activity tabs) for **ArgoCD** (`Application`, `ApplicationSet`, `AppProject`) and **FluxCD** (`GitRepository`, `OCIRepository`, `HelmRepository`, `Bucket`, `Kustomization`, `HelmRelease`, `Alert`)
- **Diagnosis pipeline** — field-level drift, recent events per resource, stuck-drift-loop detection, parsed operation-failures, structured one-click remediation
- **Lifecycle awareness** — `Terminating` chip replaces stale Sync/Health badges; severity ramps with deletion age; mutating ops refuse on zombies
- **Cross-linked from the rest of Radar** — `Managed by` chip in resource drawers, GitOps routing from Topology + Timeline + Helm view, `Consumed by` panel on Flux source CRs
- **MCP integration** — `manage_gitops` exposes sync / suspend / resume / reconcile / rollback with lifecycle-aware refusal

See the [GitOps guide](docs/gitops.md) for the full feature matrix, RBAC requirements, demo cluster, and single-cluster scope notes.

### Traffic

Visualize live network traffic between services using Hubble or Caretta.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/traffic-view.png" alt="Traffic View" width="800">
  <br><em>Traffic View — See how services communicate in real-time</em>
</p>

- Auto-detects Hubble (Cilium), Caretta, or Istio as traffic data sources
- Animated flow graph showing requests per second between services
- Filter by namespace, protocol, or status code
- Setup wizard to install a traffic source if none is detected

### Cost Insights

Track Kubernetes spending with OpenCost integration — no additional configuration needed.

- Cluster hourly and projected monthly cost, top namespaces by spend
- Cost trend charts with 6h/24h/7d range selector
- Namespace and workload-level cost breakdowns with efficiency scoring
- Node costs with instance type and region pricing
- Appears automatically when OpenCost metrics are detected in Prometheus

### Cluster Audit

Proactive best-practices scanner with 31 checks across security, reliability, and efficiency — inspired by Polaris, Kubescape, Trivy, and NSA/CISA guidelines. Runs instantly against cached data with zero cluster-side installation.

- Security: privileged containers, privilege escalation, dangerous/insecure capabilities, host namespaces, container runtime socket mounts, sensitive host paths, secrets in ConfigMaps, auto-mounted service account tokens
- Reliability: missing probes, image tag `latest`, single-replica deployments, missing PDB/topology spread, pod HA risk (all replicas on same node), orphan services/ingresses, deprecated API versions
- Efficiency: missing CPU/memory requests and limits, orphan ConfigMaps/Secrets, resource utilization vs requests
- Grouped-by-resource and by-namespace views with search, category/severity/framework filters
- Each finding includes description and remediation guidance, with inline hide actions (per-check, per-category, per-namespace)
- Configurable: ignored namespaces (with wildcard patterns), disabled checks, persisted across sessions
- Framework labels: NSA/CISA, CIS benchmarks
- MCP tool (`get_cluster_audit`) for AI-assisted cluster analysis

### Access Control (RBAC visibility)

Inspect what any ServiceAccount can actually do — without three `kubectl describe` calls.

- **ServiceAccount detail**: direct bindings, effective permissions (per-binding and deduplicated flat view), inherited grants via implicit groups (`system:authenticated`, `system:serviceaccounts`), and "Used by Pods" closing the loop
- **Pod detail**: "Permissions" section showing the most-permissive rules the Pod's SA grants, plus a blast-radius alert when the SA has wildcards, cluster-admin, escalation verbs, or cluster-wide `create pods`
- **Workload detail** (Deployment / StatefulSet / DaemonSet): same Permissions section framed at the workload level — every Pod the workload spawns inherits these grants
- **Namespace detail**: RBAC summary with RoleBindings configured here + ClusterRoleBindings whose subjects reference this namespace
- **Role / ClusterRole detail**: who is bound to this role, with subject summaries inline
- **RoleBinding detail**: inline preview of the rules the binding grants + warnings when subjects include wide groups (`system:authenticated`, `system:unauthenticated`, `system:masters`)
- **"My Permissions" panel**: namespace-scoped live `SelfSubjectRulesReview` for the current user — for fast "why can't I do X" debugging
- **MCP**: `get_subject_permissions` tool exposes the same data to AI assistants for "is this SA over-privileged?" / "blast radius if compromised?" queries

Considered for follow-ups, deliberately not in this pass — RBAC audit checks (wildcard / cluster-admin / orphan-binding / unused-role detection, Kubescape-aligned), a verb × resource matrix view on the SA page (rakkess-style), a "Subject Explorer" top-level page for browsing Users / Groups without a detail page today, a graph topology view of Subject → Binding → Role → Rule (`rbac-tool viz` style), in-UI binding edits, and a "can-i" free-form query UI. Read-only visibility ships first; we'll come back once we see how operators use the reverse-lookup.

### AI Integration (MCP) <sup>beta</sup>

Radar includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server that lets AI assistants — Claude, Cursor, Copilot, and others — query your cluster through Radar.

Instead of raw `kubectl` output (verbose YAML that burns through LLM context windows), your AI gets pre-processed, token-optimized data: topology graphs, health assessments, deduplicated events, and filtered logs. Read tools are strictly read-only; write tools (restart, scale, sync) are clearly annotated and non-destructive.

Enabled by default. Disable with `--no-mcp`. See the **[MCP Guide](docs/mcp.md)** for setup instructions.

### Authentication

For shared in-cluster deployments, Radar supports optional user authentication with per-user Kubernetes RBAC.

- **Proxy mode** — works with oauth2-proxy, Pomerium, Cloudflare Access, or any auth proxy that sets forwarded headers
- **OIDC mode** — built-in login via Google, Okta, Dex, Keycloak, or any OIDC provider
- Per-user namespace scoping and write authorization via K8s impersonation
- UI adapts automatically — buttons only appear if the user has RBAC permission

No auth by default (local use). See the **[Authentication Guide](docs/authentication.md)** for setup.

## Supported Resources

Radar auto-discovers any CRD in your cluster. Popular tools get [dedicated integrations](docs/integrations.md) with topology edges, detail views, and AI summaries.

**Default chart RBAC** covers the built-in Kubernetes kinds listed below — Workloads, Networking (including NetworkPolicies and PodDisruptionBudgets), Configuration, Storage (PersistentVolumes, PersistentVolumeClaims, StorageClasses), HorizontalPodAutoscalers, ServiceAccounts, LimitRanges, ResourceQuotas, Nodes, Namespaces, and Events. RBAC objects (Roles, ClusterRoles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoleBindings) are opt-in via `rbac.viewRBAC=true`. **CRD-based integrations** (Gateway API, VerticalPodAutoscaler, ArgoCD, FluxCD, cert-manager, etc.) need both the CRD installed in your cluster *and* read access granted — most groups are default-on under `rbac.crdGroups.<name>` (e.g. `gatewayApi`, `verticalPodAutoscaler`); check `values.yaml` or add custom rules via `rbac.additionalRules`.
